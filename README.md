# AI usage
Explain how you use the AI to solve the assignment. Put all ***your used queries*** in this section & what kind of AI are you using. Declare not using AI if you didn't do this.  

Gemini 2.5 Pro was used for initially building the user interface, file separation, event handling, and doing interactions with Qt's graphics libraries, as Qt's documentation page feels quite daunting to be read by first-timers.

- How do I draw a simple line on Qt (C++)? Split the code into header and source. 
- Is there a Qt equivalent of a CSS `<div>` with flexbox and flex-direction set to row, and justify-content set to space-between, with a text label and a button inside it? (Make the code split between source and header, too) 
- How do I make it so that a QWidget stretches the remaining QHBoxLayout/QVBoxLayout space? 
- What is the equivalent of justify-content: "flex-start"; in Qt? 
- How do I get the mouse position relative to its position in a QWidget when it left clicks on the widget? 
- How do I make it so that whenever there's a mouse click on a QWidget, it renders a dot on the place the mouse clicked? (I also want to store the dots and its positions on a dynamic array) 
- About the dot on QWidget thing, I also want to have a button that clears the array of dot positions. 

# Collaboration usage
Explain how you are ***using others*** to complete the assignment in this section. Are they simply copying, learn the ideas, learn how to adapt the AI or anything involving the process. State the people if any & Please be elaborate. Declare self tought if you solved this by yourself. 

Self-taught.
